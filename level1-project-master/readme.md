# Level 1 Assessment

## Project Structure

This repo contains the following services
- people: A java 11 rest based service
- roles: A java 11 rest based service
- departments: a nodejs rest based service
- office: a nodejs rest based service

All these services run on port 80.

Each service has its own readme file. You can effectively ignore the pom.xml file in the root of this project. It is only
used to load all the java parts of the application into IntelliJ for editing. 

This project contains one more folder: a web client that displays your current progress through the assessment
- project-assessment-site: a nodejs hosted website

Your first task is to use the skills you have developed during the course to host the website on a publicly accessible
node in aws. Once you have achieved that you will be able to see the next step of the assessment. You should host the 
website using docker. 

You should break your work up into tasks and make a backlog (todo) on trello, with the highest priority tasks on top. You 
should start by cloning this project and deleting the .git directory. Then init a new git repo in this source and set the
remote to be a new github repo on your team leader's account. Your leader should invite you all to collaborate. From that
point forward you should use gitflow processes to manage your code.

Please take plenty of screenshots of your work as you progress, especially trello and the gitflow process.
